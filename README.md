# My Portfolio
This is a Django app to display my artwork portfolio online. Images and descriptions of artworks
can be added via the admin site and each image is assigned to a gallery group. The Gallery
groups can be viewed and will show a thumbnail of each item in the gallery. The thumbnails
are created utilising Bootstrap and aligned with Masonry rather than resizing the uploaded
images. Each thumbnail can be clicked to view it in detail and see description, and if earlier or 
later works in same gallery group are available, you get links to scroll over to view them.

The live website has been deployed to Heroku and can be viewed at
